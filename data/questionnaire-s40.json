Please contact  speciesandcommunities@dbca.wa.gov.au for advice if you are unsure your activity will meet the definition  of take of disturb.\n• Information on the location of threatened flora populations can be requested through Species and  Communities Program by emailing flora.data@dbca.wa.gov.au.\n• Completed application form to be emailed to: speciesandcommunities@dbca.wa.gov.au with all relevant  attachments, or forwarded to: Species and Communities Program, Department of Biodiversity, Conservation  and Attractions, Locked Bag 104 Bentley Delivery Centre WA 6983.\n• Further information may be obtained from the DBCA website Authorisation to take and disturb threatened  flora or by emailing speciesandcommunities@dbca.wa.gov.au.."
