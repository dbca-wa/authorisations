Applying high standards of scientific integrity is one of the governing principles outlined in the Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes - 8th Edition (the Code). Each person involved in the care and use of animals for scientific purposes must consider the governing principles when applying the Code to their specific circumstance.\n\nThe below clauses from the Code contribute to the ethical framework that guides decisions and actions of all people involved in the care and use of animals for scientific purposes.\n\n1.15 Regardless of the potential benefits of a project, the methods used must be scientifically valid, feasible, well designed and carefully conducted so that there is a reasonable expectation that the aims of the project will be achieved. Projects that are not scientifically valid must not be performed, no matter how mild the impact on the wellbeing of the animals.\n\n1.16 Investigators must use methods that accord with current best practice that:\n\ti. take into consideration relevant aspects of species-specific biology, physiology and behaviour\n\tii. are based on the best available scientific evidence, which includes the potential adverse impact of conditions and procedures on the wellbeing of the animals\n\tiii. include strategies to minimise adverse impacts.\n\n1.17 Animals used must be suited to the purpose of the project or activity, taking into account their biological characteristics, including morphology, physiology, behaviour, genetic makeup, temperament and behavioural conditioning, microbiological and nutritional status, and general state of health.\n\nChief Investigators are encouraged to engage with a relevant scientist or biometrician during the project planning phase to ensure projects are scientifically valid, feasible, and well designed.

The grid will have four lines of four pitfall buckets with two funnel traps per line, and one Elliott trap at each end of the four pitfall lines.  \n•\tThe project involves trapping at three sites, which will be monitored once per year for each site, and traps will be run for four consecutive nights.\n•\tIt is anticipated that it will take project personnel approximately xx hours to complete trap checking and processing of captures.\n"
