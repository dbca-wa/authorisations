# Multi-Step / Multi-Page Form Best Practices in React

1. **Single Source of Truth for Form State**  
   Keep all form data in a single state (e.g., using `react-hook-form`, `useReducer`, or context).  
   Avoid splitting form state across steps; this prevents data loss and makes validation/submission easier.

2. **Component Structure & Reusability**  
   Break down your form into small, reusable components (e.g., `TextInput`, `SelectInput`, `StepForm`, `Section`).  
   Use a parent component to manage step logic and pass only necessary props/context to children.

3. **Context for Step Management**  
   Use React Context to manage the current step, navigation, and possibly form state if not using a form library with context support.  
   This avoids prop drilling and keeps navigation logic centralized.

4. **Validation Strategy**  
   Validate fields on change, blur, or step submit, not just on final submit.  
   Show validation errors per step to guide users before moving forward.

5. **Persisting Data Between Steps**  
   Store form data in a way that persists across steps (e.g., in context, or a parent componentâ€™s state).  
   Optionally, persist to `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` for long forms or to support page reloads.

6. **Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Inputs**  
   Prefer controlled components for complex forms, but libraries like `react-hook-form` allow performant uncontrolled inputs with easy validation.

7. **Accessibility**  
   Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.  
   Ensure keyboard navigation works for all steps and fields.  
   Provide clear error messages and focus management.

8. **Navigation & Routing**  
   For multi-page forms, use a router (e.g., React Router) to manage steps as routes.  
   For multi-step (single page), manage step index in state/context.

9. **Progress Indication**  
   Show users their progress (e.g., step indicators, progress bars).  
   This improves usability and reduces abandonment.

10. **Submission & API Integration**  
    Gather all data at the end for a single API call, or submit per step if needed.  
    Handle loading, success, and error states gracefully.

11. **Edge Cases**  
    Handle browser navigation (back/forward), refresh, and accidental exits.  
    Optionally, warn users before leaving with unsaved changes.

12. **Testing**  
    Write unit and integration tests for form logic, validation, and navigation.  
    Test edge cases like skipping steps, invalid data, and incomplete submissions.
